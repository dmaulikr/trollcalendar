A troll sits in the center of a set of seven platforms.
Each platform contains nine tiles, each with a specific size.
At midnight each night, the troll moves one tile on each
platform, following the rules for the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.

Five times a year, the tiles arrange in a single stack. One
of these times of year is the spring equinox, when the sun's
shadow aligns with the edge of the tile away from the equator.

The app starts out displaying the configuration for the date

the gestures recognized by the app.

Single tap displays this help screen.

Double tap resets the configuration to today's date.

Swipe toward the east advances one day.

After one minute of no gestures, the app reverts to the current
date. The configuration will automatically change at midnight.
